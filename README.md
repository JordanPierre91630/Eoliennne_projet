# Eoliennne_projet
This is a small personal project
We have developed a python functions that allows to plot bathymetric data and superposed eolian parcs shape files over it.
The other function inside the .py file return zonal statistique of a single given shape file.

The Jupyter notebook is mainly to detail how those two function work and how they came to be.

One of the main issue encounter is with the different libraries instaled mainly geopanda and the required Fiona. I sugest creating a new environement.

required library includes : geopandas, rasterio, rasterstat and netcdf.
