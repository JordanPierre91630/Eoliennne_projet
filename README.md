# Eoliennne_projet
This is a small personal project
The main objective is to devellope a Python script capable of ploting a bathymetric map and superpose known eolian parcs shape file unto it.
As of now the Notbook is capable of :
  - Reading Bathymetric date in NETcdf format, plot said data as a nathymetric map for a specific case.
  - The notebbok is also capable of superposing two shape file of off shore eolian parcs for a specific case.

Now we are looking to :
  - Extract releveant bathymetric data (namely max, min and mean depth) for the are occupied by the parcs shapes
  - Generalize the script to be able to do the samething with file input from an user
  - transfer the Notebook to a normal python script
